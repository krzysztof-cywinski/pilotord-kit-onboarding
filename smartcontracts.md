# Interaction with smart contracts

## Objective

This documentation aims to explain how interaction with the smart contracts available on the Real Digital Pilot Network will be done.

As this is a pilot in a test environment, this documentation is subject to constant evolutions that will be reflected here.

The participant of the pilot will be provided with the ABI of each of the contracts and their respective addresses published on the network. Each participant must implement, in the way that best understands, their interaction with the contracts, making use of standard Web3 libraries such as, for example, [Web3JS](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.10.0/), [Web3J](https://docs.web3j.io/4.10.0/), or frameworks such as [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) or [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/).

In the pilot, all contracts will be implemented and published on the network by the Central Bank of Brazil.

## Smart Contracts

The contracts that represent tokens (Real Digital, Tokenized Real, Federal Public Title) were developed using the [ERC20](https://ethereum.org/pt/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) standard as a basis, with the addition of [specific access control functions](./CBDCAccessControl.md).
All tokens support 2 decimal places.

### CBDC - [Real Digital](./RealDigital.md)

The CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) is defined in the contract called [RealDigital](./abi/RealDigital.json).
* The wallet of the Central Bank of Brazil is the token manager.
* The token symbol is `BRL`.
* Only authorized wallets can receive Real Digital.
* Each participant must send the address of their main wallet to the Central Bank of Brazil for registration. This wallet will be the participant's default wallet. After the initial registration, the participant can enable other wallets to receive Real Digital, as well as change their default wallet.

The default wallet will be mainly used in the swap contracts, detailed below.

### DVt and MEt - [Tokenized Real](./RealTokenizado.md)

Tokenized Real is defined in the contract called [RealTokenizado](./abi/RealTokenizado.json).
* The participant's default wallet will be the token manager, but the creation of the token on the network will be done by the Central Bank of Brazil.
* The token symbol is to be defined.
* Like Real Digital, only authorized wallets can receive Tokenized Real.
* The participant must use the `enableAccount` and `disableAccount` methods to manage the allowed wallets.

### [STR](./STR.md)

The contract called [STR](./abi/STR.json) represents how participants will request Real Digital from the Central Bank of Brazil. This contract allows any participant to request the minting of Real Digital, provided that their wallet is registered, using the `requestToMint` method.

### [Real Digital Default Account](./RealDigitalDefaultAccount.md)

The [RealDigitalDefaulAccount](./abi/RealDigitalDefaultAccount.json) contract allows the participant to change their default wallet through the `updateDefaultWallet` method. Also, through the `defaultAccount` mapping, it is possible to recover the default wallet of other participants, simply by passing their CNPJ8 as a parameter. This operation will be necessary for swap transactions.

### [Real Digital Enable Account](./RealDigitalEnableAccount.md)

The [RealDigitalEnableAccount](./abi/RealDigitalEnableAccount.json) contract allows the participant to enable other wallets they own to receive Real Digital, through the `enableAccount` method.

### [KeyDictionary](./KeyDictionary.md)

The [KeyDictionary](./abi/KeyDictionary.json) contract simulates a DICT for Real Digital. During the pilot, fictitious client data must be inserted into the network for recovery during swap operations.
The method to be invoked for data insertion is `addAccount`, which has the following parameters:

* Key, a unique identifier generated by the participant, must be saved in keccak256 hash format
* CPF of the fictitious client
* Participant code
* Fictitious client account
* Fictitious client

## Swap and Off-Chain Communication

The swap contracts allow the exchange of Tokenized Real between participants, using Real Digital as a reserve.

At the moment, there are two available implementations: one that executes the swap in just [one transaction](./abi/SwapOneStep.json) and another that depends on the [receiver's approval](./abi/SwapTwoSteps.json) for the exchange to be completed, thus requiring two transactions on the network.

For more details, read the documentation of the [SwapOneStep](./SwapOneStep.md) and [SwapTwoSteps](./SwapTwoSteps.md) contracts.

The objective of the pilot is to test the two forms of swap, as well as a third that will still be implemented and involves off-chain information exchange.
