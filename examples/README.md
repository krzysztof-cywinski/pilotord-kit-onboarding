# Examples of interaction with smart contracts

Here are some examples of interaction with smart contracts, in order to guide the development by the participants.

The examples will be written in Typescript using the [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) framework. This is not a recommendation for the use of the tool by the Central Bank of Brazil. Participants are free to develop interaction with smart contracts in any way they see fit.

This code has been tested but no audit or vulnerability analysis has been performed. We do not recommend its use in production, especially the use of private keys in the Hardhat configuration file.

[Example 1](example1.ts):
    Enable Account / Mint and Burn.

[Example 2](example2.ts):
    Get participant's default account and perform CBDC transfer.

[Example 3](example3.ts):
    Participant activating an address for a client and performing a DVt or MEt issuance.

[Exemplo 4](example4.ts):
Participante buscando o endereço de Real Digital no contrato de AddressDiscovery.

[Exemplo 5](example5.ts):
Operação 1002: Registro de liquidação de oferta pública. 

[Exemplo 6](example6.ts):
Operação 1052: Registro de operação de compra e venda entre participantes.
